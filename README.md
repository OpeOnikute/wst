# WST

Wst is named after Wan Shi Tong, a character in Avatar The Last Airbender, who is an all-knowing librarian that can also direct you to specific resources to gain knowledge.

This extension allows you share a link to any part of a website. Usually you would rely on the website itself providing a link to a specific section. 

With wst, all you need to do is highlight a text. When you do, the extension comes alive and you can copy the URL.
